# Glossary

A Developers Institute centric glossary of terms.

At Developers Institute we try to use industry relevant terms rather than education specific words.

## The Glossary

* Tech Lead: Instructor / Tutor / Mentor - Person running classes and delivering teaching material.
* Meeting: Class / Lecture / Tutorial - Instructor lead tutorial sessions.
* Standup: Daily team meeting - Daily team meeting, usually at the start of the day, to cover off what each team member is up to for the day, and to raise / ask questions.
